  <head><title>Hello, world; this is R2HQ</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Early-stage talent acquisition support, consulting for established companies & hiring managers, and solo recruiter & sourcer. </h1>
    <p>True generalist experience: I spike in early-stage technical hiring and sourcing/headhunting passive talent, but I have a wide range of high-volume, GTM, G&A, VC, volunteer, and contract recruitment. </p>
    <p>My goal for founders and hiring managers -- remove all the busy work from the recruitment process so you can focus on 1) building and 2) speaking with builders. Simultaneously, our goal isn't for you to become dependent on our services -- we want to empower you to do more on your own, know what "great recruitment" looks like, and feel confident your company's recruitment processes are set up to thrive.</p>
    <p>My goal for job seekers/talent -- get to know you, your career goals, and what kind of work/problem energizes you. From there, connect you with an elite network of companies I've built relationships with over the past decade via working with staffing agencies, in-house, and in venture capital. In cases where I can't offer immediate roles, my aim is to be able to offer external connections and/or new job search strategies to help you find your next opportunity. </p>
    <p>Sample placements: VP Eng at System Initiative, Director of Product Management at Chainguard, founding or early-hire roles at Hex, Modal, Temporal, bitdrift, Scribe, Eppo, Diagrid, Fermyon, Achira AI, Covariant, YeshID, and more </p>
